# 🏊 lake-vm
A simple virtual machine, with example byte-code program.

Written entirely in C11, this is a very crude experiment and is in no way meant to be used for anything but looking at.
It implments a stack based VM that also has a set of registers with specific/non-specific 
use cases, this is clearly not optimal for compilers
