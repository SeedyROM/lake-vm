# 🏊 lake-vm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeedyROM/lake-vm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SeedyROM/lake-vm)

A simple virtual machine, with example byte-code program.

Written entirely in C11, this is a very crude experiment and is in no way meant to be used for anything but looking at.
It implments a stack based VM that also has a set of registers with specific/non-specific 
use cases, this is clearly not optimal for compilers

But this was mostly a fun project in understanding how computers and CPUs work in general.
